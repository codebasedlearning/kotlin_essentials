Welcome to our crash course. A few introductory words about Kotlin:
  - Like many other languages, Kotlin has code blocks enclosed in {}, block comments enclosed in /* */ and
    line comments starting with //.
  - Let's start with a question: Where do you find a difference to Java already here in this comment?
    (hint below)

At the beginning of each snippet, you will find some information about what this piece of code is all about.
For example, in this first code file we talk about 'main' and run it.
  - All programs need a starting point, and that is 'main'. There is usually only one 'main' for a program,
    but as we have several individual small units that we discuss, there is one 'main' per code snippet
    and no global 'main' (for Gradle-projects: this is usually specified in build.gradle.kts (mainClass.set)).
  - First task to start with:
    * IntelliJ: Run this 'main' by clicking on the green triangle next to 'fun main'. You can also run it from
      the main or context menu (cursor on 'fun main', 'run MainKt').
    * Other-IDE: Use the specific run method provided by your IDE to execute this 'main'.

Structure:
  - If the snippet (or folder) has a 'More' part, it is for study in the exercises.
  - There are also exercises and suggested solutions in folder 'exercises'.
    Feel free to solve the puzzles described in 'Tasks_*.md'.
  - Task names are candy names, see: https://www.fantasynamegenerators.com/candy-names.php

Comments hint: Many programming languages do not allow nested block comments - Kotlin does!
